## Overview
It is a MATLAB toolkit designed to streamline preprocessing of multimodal EEG datasets. It supports diverse data modalities including EEG, motion capture (MoCap), behavioral metrics, and analog data (e.g., photodiode). It offers a workflow for data preprocessing, statistical analysis, MVPA, and visualization.
